<p>Problems with accesibility..who needs it?</p>
<ul>
<li>daltonics</li>
<li>blindness</li>
<li><span id="anchor"></span>deafness</li>
<li>multiple esclerosity</li>
<li>motor problems</li>
<li>cognitive problesm</li>
</ul>
<p>How do blind people navigate the web? Use of a screen reader.</p>
<p>Since html is text, it can be used to synthetyse speech (meaning read
the tags and the text). So everything can be talked. One problem :
images, and forms. Layout of the page, important to perceive as
well?</p>
<p>Why do we need accesibility measures? To determinate a scale, which
says that a page is , for example 30% accessilely? To create another
page, with better ranks? </p>
<p>Possible aproach, convert the non-ranked metrics, to another language
(easier to learn/to perceive), with that language, being better than a
web page tailored for accessility ?</p>
<p>Save of money and time, invested on rules (creating , evaluating,
etc).</p>
<p>Problems with reading html text</p>
<p>Not too much optimized (a person can limit the speed of the
voice)</p>
<p>Not too fast</p>
<p>Not to accurate</p>
<p>html was not designed to be used by blind people (a new language
would be 100% suitable for blind people..no need to evaluate pages)</p>
<p>New language objectives</p>
<p>- easy to learn</p>
<p>- be expressive</p>
<p>- no ambiguity (a text field is rectangular, so is a window)</p>
<p>- can be read easly be screen readers</p>
<p>- use of sound to do enumeraous things, like sound of "A", means its
a &lt;h1&gt; header..to complement or substitute text? ...associate with
actions?</p>
<p>- suitable for blind people</p>
<p>-another device , suitable for reading the new language </p>
<p>-Needs to inform the blind people , of the layout / position of www
objects (mainly study dimensions)</p>
<p>-much easier to perceive</p>
<p>-represent text, images, and forms.</p>
<p>-faster to read</p>
<p>-use of sound to do something or perceive something (sound letter "A"
-&gt; &lt;h1&gt;, sound lettter "B" -&gt;&lt;table&gt;</p>
<p>-needs to output to a display (any display)</p>
<p>-use tags or not tags? tags as in &lt;h1&gt;</p>
<p>-interact with forms..or any general interaction</p>
<p> <strong>End objectives</strong></p>
<p>Learn how blind people , perceive information, because that will be
critical. Use psycologhy, artificial intelligence,linguistics,interface
person machine...etc...</p>
<p>blind persons need geometry, to handle dimensions, and to perceive
the page. For example, a window left 50cm from margin-right, a rectangle
that is in center, a polygon in center. A blind person needs to know
what a window is, hence it must have some knowledge of HTML concepts.
HTML language, establishes some tags. Then the webmaster, use those
tags, one or more times. Should blind people , learn html ?</p>
<p>How would blind people learn? text, sound ? blind people have a very
good hearing system, (and again associated with psycology), connecting
perception with sound.</p>
<p>A new language , would have to be learn either when kids (possible
kids, tend to learn faster?) or when adults.</p>
<p>Blind people must have perception of space and geometry (as refered
above), to know how rectangles are different, and where they are
positioned. No problem in learning geometry , since it is good things
for the blind people (not just reading web pages), no matter how its
used (say a blind people , gets ...the bus stop is 30 meters from
here)</p>
<p>mostly what we are assured. We have text(ok, can be read), images
(can be drawned). What about forms? how to handle? ...forms means
interaction with the user.</p>
<p>How can a blind people , interact with www pages? In this case it
would interact with the new language.</p>
<p>Everything in a gui (desktop, web pages), is a rectangle
(button,windows,icons,etc).</p>
<p>Interaction</p>
<p>How do blind people use cellular phones, and forms (web pages forms,
or desktop forms). Means of interaction...new language needs to specify
an easy way to handle interaction...</p>
<p>Do we need to convert HTML and CSS to the new language. As far as CSS
goes, it would be best , if a person would choose to use the CSS. Mainly
"Let me check color of H1" , and from there use style sheets...</p>
<p>Another language</p>
<p>What about , instead of a new language, convert the normal webpages,
to html made for blind people? (html to html...)</p>
<p>convert some tags (what tags) , create other tags...rearranje html so
it can be easly read by screen readers.</p>
<p>A major problem</p>
<p>interaction between blind and display (including how blind people use
cell-phones, or any kind of devices)...needs to be studied. Mainly the
whole problem is interacting with displays...</p>
<p>No need for a operating system. Use usb and a tablet. Software doesnt
need o.s, could be a desktop application. on xwindows , we can put an
application receiving events..those events can be anything, like
keystrokes, signals, etc. </p>
<p>Use default keystrokes on each object. Say to terminate an app, on
linux, use CTRL-C, that would also stop the web page, from being
displayed...say, CTRL-X , print web page in braille.</p>
<p>Should the screen reader, be used to say related information from a
tag? Say</p>
<p>&lt;h1&gt; hello &lt;/h1&gt; , should the reader speaks hello and
this is in tag named h1?</p>
<p>What should the screen reader use to read ? it would say "This site
is google.pt" </p>
<p>can we convert images to sound? Its known that blind people, have
good hearing. some frequencies associate with images for example? better
use sound that braille?</p>
<p>convert image, to device. use pressure points on the device, so,
blind people can read them. Needs several states on one bit. Use
pressure points, to distinguish each state on a position.</p>
<p>LAYOUT PROBLEMS</p>
<p>should we use caracteristics of the text, or should we use raw text.
Say , in html, &lt;h1&gt; means large text. Is this important? what if
blind people , know the dimensions , and layouts, doesnt matter if text
is big or not?. Is this required for a good experience with web
pages?</p>
<p>I have a "TITLE_HERE". does it matter if its "tittle_here" ? Nope
because they can't distinguish them...they can only visualize the
concept..so, on title, they would visualize a big title? Again
dimensions, and geometry are needed to understand from blind people.
</p>
<p>How to perceive forms?! Again...important to know psycologhy, a.i,
etc, to help perceive forms</p>
<p>How to use colors?</p>
<p>use numbers to assign colors, to make them distuiguishable...say red
equals 1, green equals 2 (can also use sound)</p>
<p>So we can associate a sound, or number, to a concept.</p>
<p>Access the brain with sounds, a direct connection, to a human image
system? meaning each sound would represent an image, or parts of it?
several sounds represent a image?</p>
<p>can we resume the webpage ? (what its about, what images, and
characteritics it has)</p>
<p>What if the whole page, were represented in device? device could use,
the different texture of materials to draw a page, so blidn people could
learn the shapes.</p>
<p>show draft to blind people</p>
<p><img src="images/bird_shape.jpeg">
style="width:7.228cm;height:5.415cm" /></p>
<p>complete image (we want this to be better than the before draft)</p>
<p><img src="images/bird_ok.jpeg">
style="width:7.228cm;height:5.415cm" /></p>
<p>the objective is to blind people perceive the complete image...</p>
<p>use comparasions? like, this bird has size of a known concept?</p>
<p>the wing, is close to other wings? again dimensions are important
(geometry)</p>
<p>use a new device (specifically to browse web) , with some buttons
(like "-&gt; " forward, "&lt;-" backwards, "R" reload page...etc</p>
<p>Either we convert text, to speech, or the text must be perceived by
braille. unless sound is used....sound is used..speech is sound. </p>
<p>can't assing sound to text area..too many text to convert...</p>
<p>instead of css, use sound (like red : 1 number, position : 3 fixed
top : 10 number 9 ...), or another type of css (used with a new
language)</p>
